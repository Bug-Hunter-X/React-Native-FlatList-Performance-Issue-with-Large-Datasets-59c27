This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in React Native's FlatList component when dealing with large datasets. The bug results in a blank screen or crashes due to inefficient rendering. The solution involves implementing proper optimization techniques, such as using `keyExtractor`, `getItemLayout`, and potentially `windowSize` to improve rendering performance and prevent the issue.
